@section Copying Conditions

Neper is ``free software''; this means that everyone is free to use it and
to redistribute it on a free basis. Neper is not in the public domain; it is
copyrighted and there are restrictions on its distribution, but these
restrictions are designed to permit everything that a good cooperating
citizen would want to do.  What is not allowed is to try to prevent others
from further sharing any version of Neper that they might get from you.

Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give away
copies of Neper, that you receive source code or else can get it if you want
it, that you can change Neper or use pieces of Neper in new free programs,
and that you know you can do these things.

To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to deprive
anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute copies of
Neper, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must
make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must
tell them their rights.

Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone finds out
that there is no warranty for Neper.  If Neper is modified by someone else
and passed on, we want their recipients to know that what they have is not
what we distributed, so that any problems introduced by others will not
reflect on our reputation.

The precise conditions of the license for Neper are found in the General
Public License that accompanies the source code (@pxref{GNU General
Public License}). Further
information about this license is available from the GNU Project webpage

The Neper software package can be downloaded from
@url{http://neper.sourceforge.net}. It has also two dedicated mailing
lists,

@itemize
@item neper-announce: the ``read-only'' list for important news: new
releases, bug fixes, etc. (low traffic, highly recommended!)

@w{To subscribe, visit
@url{https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/neper-announce}}.
The list is archived at
@url{http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=neper-announce}.

@item neper-users: the ``read-write'' list for users.  Please send all
questions, bug reports, requests or any errors or omissions in this
manual to this list.  

@w{To subscribe, visit
@url{https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/neper-users}};
@w{to send a message, use @email{neper-users@@lists.sourceforge.net}}.
The list is archived at
@url{http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=neper-users}.
@end itemize

The best way to get help is by sending a message to
@email{neper-users@@lists.sourceforge.net}.  Note that you do not have
to subscribe to the list to be able to send a message, nor to receive
the reply.  If you wish to contact the developer directly, use
@email{rquey@@users.sourceforge.net}.
