@node Module -M
@chapter Tessellation Meshing: neper -M

@MM{} is the module for meshing tessellations and voxel data.  It is
possible to generate a mesh into tetrahedral elements (for
tessellations) or a non-conforming mesh into regular hexahedral
elements.  Meshing into tetrahedral elements is carried out so has to
get a mesh into elements of size as close as possible to a desired
target value, and of high quality, that is, of equilateral shape.  The
input file is a tessellation file (@file{.tess}), as provided by @mT{},
or a voxel file (@file{.vox}).  The output mesh can be written in
several formats.

Several options are available for specifying the desired mesh properties. 
The target element size of the mesh can be specified through the
following parameters:

@itemize
@item The @dfn{characteristic length (@code{cl})}. It corresponds to the
target size of the elements.  This size is the length of a line element
(1D), and the length of the edge of a triangle element (2D) and
of a tetrahedral element (3D). For convenience, a value
relative to the average polyhedron size, @code{rcl}, is also defined:
@iftex
@math{@code{rcl} = 2 * @code{cl} / (@code{average_poly_volume}^{1/3})}.
@end iftex
@ifinfo
2 x @code{cl} / @code{average_poly_volume}@^{1/3}.
@end ifinfo

@c @item The @dfn{progression factor (@code{pl})} controls the gradient in
@c element size. It is the maximum ratio allowed between two neighbouring
@c elements.
@end itemize

For meshing into tetrahedra,  mesh quality is ensured to the greatest
extent possible using several advanced capabilities:

@itemize

@item Optimized meshing rules.  The mesh properties are controlled by
size parameters (options @option{-cl}, @option{-rcl}, etc.) and a size
gradient parameter used for 1D meshing (option @option{-pl}).

@item Multimeshing.  Each tessellation face and volume is meshed
separately of the others, with several meshing algorithms, and to the
mesh of best quality is retained.  This is needed for meshing Voronoi
tessellations, and has the advantage of ensuring meshing robustness and
optimizing mesh quality.  This is controlled by options
@option{-mesh2dalgo} and @option{-mesh3dalgo}.

@c The Gmsh library is used for both 2D and 3D meshings.  For 2D
@c meshing, four algorithms are available: {@code{made}
@c (MeshAdapt+Delaunay)}, {@code{mead} (MeshAdapt)}, {@code{dela}
@c (Delaunay)} and {@code{fron} (Frontal)}.  For 3D meshing, there is
@c currently only one available meshing algorithm: {@code{netg} (Netgen)},
@c but it can be coupled to three different optimization algorithms:
@c {@code{gmsh} (Gmsh)}, {@code{netg} (Netgen)}, and {@code{gmne}
@c (Gmsh+Netgen)}.  For 2D meshing, an entry like @code{fron,made} (which
@c is actually the default entry) leads to each face being meshed by
@c @code{netg} and @code{mage} and the better-quality mesh being used.  For
@c 3D meshing, the algorithm includes a meshing and an optimization
@c algorithm, combined @w{by @code{/}}, @w{e.g.@ @code{netg/gmsh}}.  A
@c valid entry could be @code{netg/gmsh,netg/netg,netg/gmne} (leading to
@c maximum quality). 
@end itemize

Remeshing can also be applied to generate a new, good-quality mesh on a
mesh containing poor-quality elements (options starting by
@option{-remesh}).  The variables defined on the old mesh can be
transported on the new mesh (options starting by @option{-transport}).

Mesh cleaning options enable to remove isolated elements or to duplicate
nodes subjected to singularity behaviour (options @option{-clean} and
@option{-singnodedup}). This is especially useful meshing into
hexahedral elements of voxel data.

Mesh partitioning capabilities enable to divide the mesh nodes and
elements into several sets while minimizing the interfaces between
them@footnote{Each partition being assigned to a processor in the finite
element calculation, the minimization of the interfaces between the
partitions is done in terms of the number of necessary communications
between processors.}, for parallel finite element calculations.
Partitioning can return any number of partitions, or more efficiently,
can be carried out according to a given parallel computer architecture,
in which case the number of partition must be a power of 2 (options
starting by @option{-part}). 

In the output mesh, the individual entities of the tessellations (the
volumes, the faces, the edges and the vertices) are described by element
sets (option @option{-outdim}).  Node sets of the faces, the edges and
the vertices of the surface of the tessellation are also provided for
prescribing the boundary conditions (option @option{-nset}).  The
surface element sets are also provided (option @option{-faset}).  The
mesh order can be 1 or 2, respectively (option @option{-order}).
Statistical data can be obtained on the meshes (options starting by
@option{-stat}).

Options are also available to work on an existing mesh
(options starting by @option{-loadmesh}).

@c any, all}

@sp 1
The following options define the 2D and 3D meshing algorithms.  The
algorithms have the format @samp{@var{mesh}} or
@samp{@var{mesh}/@var{opti}}, where @code{@var{mesh}} and
@code{@var{opti}} stand for the meshing and optimization algorithms and
are 4-character long. (The @samp{:} character can also be used as a
separator.) @emph{Multimeshing} can be used by providing
several algorithms combined with commas, e.g@.
@code{@var{mesh1}/@var{opti1},@var{mesh1}/@var{opti2},@var{mesh2}/@var{opti2}}.
The 2D and 3D meshings are carried out using the Gmsh@footnote{Ch.@
Geuzaine and J.-F. Remacle, Gmsh: a three-dimensional finite element
mesh generator with built-in pre- and post-processing facilities,
International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering, 79,
1309--1331, 2009.} and Netgen@footnote{J. Schoberl, Netgen, an advancing
front 2d/3d-mesh generator based on abstract rules.  Comput.  Visual.
Sci., 52, 1--41, 1997.} libraries (see the Gmsh reference manual for
information on the algorithms).@*

For 2D meshing, the available values of @code{@var{mesh}} are
@code{mead} (MeshAdapt), @code{dela}
(Delaunay) and @code{fron} (Frontal). There is no optimization.  The
default is @code{fron,mead} and it is recommended to retain multimeshing
in use for meshing robustness sake. For 3D meshing, the available
values of @code{@var{mesh}} are currently limited to @code{netg}
(Netgen).  The available values of @code{@var{opti}} are @code{gmsh}
(Gmsh), @code{netg} (Netgen) and @code{gmne} (Gmsh+Netgen).
@c While the
@c default algorithm, @code{netg/gmne}, provides quite good quality
@c meshing, multimeshing can improve results significantly.
For convenience, two generic entries are also defined.  The entry
@code{default}, which is the default value, provides a good balance
between mesh quality and computation time.  The entry @code{qualmax}
provides the best results on mesh quality (full use of multimeshing).
The values of @code{default} are @code{fron,mead} for the 2D case and
@code{netg/gmsh,netg/gmne} for the 3D case.  The values of
@code{qualmax} are @code{mead,dela,fron} for the 2D case and
@code{netg/gmsh,netg/netg,netg/gmne} for the 3D case.

@opt{-mesh2dalgo, char_string,
Specify the 2D meshing algorithm.
Multimeshing is allowed by providing several algorithms@comma{}
(combine with commas).,

optimization@comma{} as a function of @var{Odis} and @var{Osize} (see
the Neper paper).,
any, Odis^0.8*Osize^0.2}

@optsec{-mesh3doptidisexpr, char_string,
Specify the value of @math{@var{Odis}} for the multimeshing
optimization@comma{} as a function of the element distortion parameter
@var{dis} (see the Neper paper).,

@c @optdevel{-mesh3dreport, logical,
@c Report statistical data on the 3D meshing.,
@c 0 or 1, 0}

@subsection Domain Boundary Meshing Options

These options are for specifying geometry regularization and meshing
conditions for the polyhedra at the domain boundary different than those
that apply to the inner polyhedra.  This applies to meshing into
tetrahedral elements and is useful for coarsening the
meshes of the boundary grains when they are disregarded in the analysis
due to possible boundary effects.
The domain boundary polyhedra can be defined using the
following variables: 
@itemize
@item @code{@var{body}}: the minimum number of polyhedra between the
considered polyhedron and the domain boundary. Its value is 0 for
polyhedra intersecting the domain boundary, and increases with the
distance to the domain boundary.

@item @code{@var{true}}: a polyhedron is said to be @dfn{true} if its
shape is not biased by the domain boundary.  This requires the
polyhedron not to be cut by the domain boundary, but actually the
condition is a bit more restrictive.  The value of @code{@var{true}}
is an integer equal to 0 for polyhedra which do not match the
above-mentionned criterion, and higher values otherwise.
For the latter cases, the value of @code{@var{true}} is defined to be
equal to @math{n} for true polyhedra surrounded by polyhedra whose value
of @code{@var{true}} is higher than or equal to @math{(n-1)}.  This
definition is consistent with the one of the @code{@var{body}} variable,
in terms of how the values of neighbouring grains compare.  As for
@code{@var{body}}, the value of @code{@var{true}} increases with the
distance to the domain boundary, but typically
@iftex
@math{@var{true} @leq @var{body}}.
@end iftex
@ifinfo
true <= body.
@end ifinfo

@end itemize

@opt{-dbound,char_string,
Define which polyhedra belong to the domain boundary.  The expression
can be based on the following arguments: @code{body} and @code{true}.
An example is @code{"body<=1"}.
,
any, none}

@opt{-dboundcl and -dboundrcl,real,
Absolute or relative characteristic length of the elements at the domain
boundary.  @code{rcl} is defined relative to the average polyhedron
volume.
,
any, none}

@optsec{-dboundpl,real,
Progression factor for the element characteristic lengths at the domain
boundary. This value is the maximum ratio between the lengths of two
adjacent 1D elements.,
any >= 1, 2}

@subsection Remeshing Options

@opt{-remesh,file_name,
Use this option for remeshing a mesh.  Provide as
  argument the mesh file.,
any,none}

@opt{-remeshtess,file_name,
Use this option to specify a tessellation associated to the mesh to
remesh.  This can be useful@comma{} for example@comma{} when the meshed
domain is not a regular box@comma{} to determine the node sets.  Provide
as argument the tessellation file.,
any,none}

@opt{-transport, file_name integer char_string char_string file_name ...,
Use this option for transporting data from a parent mesh to a child mesh
(typically obtained by remeshing).  First provide the name of the
parent mesh file. The child mesh is taken as the result mesh
(usually obtained by remeshing@comma{} but it can also be loaded
with @option{-loadmesh}).  Then provide as argument the number of
different data to transport; then@comma{} for each of them@comma{}
@code{elt} (mandatory)@comma{} the type of data (under the format
@code{[integer@comma{}real]X}@comma{} where @code{X} is the dimension) and
the name of the file containing the parent data.,
any,0}

@opt{-transporttess,file_name,
Use this option to specify a tessellation associated to the mesh from
which the data are transported.  This is not mandatory.
Provide as argument the tessellation file.,
any,none}

@subsection Mesh Cleaning Options

@optsec{-clean,integer,
Clean mesh so that the mesh consists of a set of connected elements.
Provide as argument the level of cleaning.  This option applies only
to voxel data meshing.
A value of @code{1} indicates that two elements should be considered
connected to each other if they share at least a vertex. 
A value of @code{2} indicates that two elements should be considered
connected to each other if they share at least a face. 
Using this option@comma{} the elements (or bunch of elements) that are
not connected to the main skeleton are removed.
,
0 to 2,0}

@optsec{-singnodedup,logical,
Duplicate nodes which are the subject of singularity.  Such a node
belongs to several elements which share only a node or an
edge@comma{} which provides a singularity behaviour.  In
thermics@comma{} this corresponds to imposing a given temperature at a
particular location shared by two bodies@comma{} but not enabling heat
flux to operate at that location (since the surface is zero).  In
mechanics@comma{} this corresponds to imposing a common
displacement@comma{} while the point can carry no stress.
When this option is enabled@comma{}
such a node is duplicated@comma{} so that each body has its own node. 
,
0 or 1,0}
