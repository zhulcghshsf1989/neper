@node Module -FM
@chapter Tessellation Free Meshing: neper -FM

@MFM{} is the module to generate a free mesh of a tessellation, that is,
a mesh comprised of tetrahedral elements that conform to the
tessellation morphology.  The aim is to generate a mesh into elements of
size as close as possible to a desired target value, and of high
quality, that is, of equilateral shape.
The input file is a tessellation file (@file{.tess}), as provided by
@mT{}.  The output mesh can be written in several formats.

Several options are available for specifying the desired mesh properties. 
The target element size of the mesh can be specified through the
following parameters:

@itemize
@item The @dfn{characteristic length (@code{cl})}. It corresponds to the
target size of the elements.  This size is the length of a line element
(1D), and the length of the edge of a triangle element (2D) and
of a tetrahedral element (3D). For convenience, a value
relative to the average polyhedron size, @code{rcl}, is also defined:
@iftex
@math{@code{rcl} = 2 * @code{cl} / (@code{average_poly_volume}^{1/3})}.
@end iftex
@ifinfo
2 x @code{cl} / @code{average_poly_volume}@^{1/3}.
@end ifinfo

@c @item The @dfn{progression factor (@code{pl})} controls the gradient in
@c element size. It is the maximum ratio allowed between two neighbouring
@c elements.
@end itemize

For ensuring mesh quality to the greatest extent possible, Neper
includes several advanced capabilities:

@itemize

@item Geometry regularization.  It consists in removing the small
features of the tessellation (the edges and faces), which are smaller
than the target element size and as a consequence would need local mesh
over-refinements.  Using this capability is done by allowing some level
of geometrical distortion, the face @dfn{flatness fault}, through option
@option{-maxff} (value in degree).

@item Multimeshing.  Each tessellation face and volume is meshed
separately of the others, with several meshing algorithms, and to the
mesh of best quality is retained.  This is needed for meshing Voronoi
tessellations, and has the advantage of ensuring meshing robustness and
optimizing mesh quality.  This is controlled by options
@option{-mesh2dalgo} and @option{-mesh3dalgo}.

@c The Gmsh library is used for both 2D and 3D meshings.  For 2D
@c meshing, four algorithms are available: {@code{made}
@c (MeshAdapt+Delaunay)}, {@code{mead} (MeshAdapt)}, {@code{dela}
@c (Delaunay)} and {@code{fron} (Frontal)}.  For 3D meshing, there is
@c currently only one available meshing algorithm: {@code{netg} (Netgen)},
@c but it can be coupled to three different optimization algorithms:
@c {@code{gmsh} (Gmsh)}, {@code{netg} (Netgen)}, and {@code{gmne}
@c (Gmsh+Netgen)}.  For 2D meshing, an entry like @code{fron,made} (which
@c is actually the default entry) leads to each face being meshed by
@c @code{netg} and @code{mage} and the better-quality mesh being used.  For
@c 3D meshing, the algorithm includes a meshing and an optimization
@c algorithm, combined @w{by @code{/}}, @w{e.g.@ @code{netg/gmsh}}.  A
@c valid entry could be @code{netg/gmsh,netg/netg,netg/gmne} (leading to
@c maximum quality). 

@item Remeshing can also be applied to generate a new, good-quality mesh on
a mesh containing poor-quality elements (options starting by
@option{-remesh}).  The variables defined on the old mesh can be
transported on the new mesh (options starting by
@option{-transport}).
@end itemize

Mesh partitioning capabilities enable to divide the mesh nodes and
elements into several sets while minimizing the interfaces between
them@footnote{Each partition being assigned to a processor in the finite
element calculation, the minimization of the interfaces between the
partitions is done in terms of the number of necessary communications
between processors.}, for parallel finite element calculations.
Partitioning can return any number of partitions, or more efficiently,
can be carried out according to a given parallel computer architecture,
in which case the number of partition must be a power of 2 (options
starting by @option{-part}). 

In the output mesh, the individual entities of the tessellations (the
volumes, the faces, the edges and the vertices) are described by element
sets (option @option{-outdim}).  Node sets of the faces, the edges and
the vertices of the surface of the tessellation are also provided for
prescribing the boundary conditions (option @option{-nset}).  The
surface element sets (triangles) are also provided (option
@option{-faset}).  The mesh order can be 1 or 2, corresponding to 3-node
tetrahedral elements and 10-node tetrahedral elements, respectively
(option @option{-order}).  Statistical data can be obtained on the
properties of the tessellations and meshes (options starting by
@option{-stat}).

Options are also available to work on an existing mesh
(options starting by @option{-loadmesh}).

any,2}

@subsection Meshing and Multimeshing Options

@opt{-cl or -rcl,real,
Absolute or relative characteristic length of the elements.
@code{rcl} is defined relative to the average polyhedron
volume.
The default @code{-rcl 1} leads to a mesh density of about 100
tetrahedral elements per grain.
,
any, -rcl 1}

any, none}

@optsec{-clmin,real,
Minimum characteristic length of the elements.  Using this option is not recommended.,
any, none}


@sp 1
The following options define the 2D and 3D-meshing algorithms.  The
algorithms have the format @samp{@var{mesh}} or
@samp{@var{mesh}/@var{opti}}, where @code{@var{mesh}} and
@code{@var{opti}} stand for the meshing and optimization algorithms and
are 4-character long. @emph{Multimeshing} can be used by providing
several algorithms combined with commas, e.g@.
@code{@var{mesh1}/@var{opti1},@var{mesh1}/@var{opti2},@var{mesh2}/@var{opti2}}.
The 2D and 3D meshings are carried out using the Gmsh@footnote{Ch.@
Geuzaine and J.-F. Remacle, Gmsh: a three-dimensional finite element
mesh generator with built-in pre- and post-processing facilities,
International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering, 79,
1309--1331, 2009.} and Netgen@footnote{J. Schoberl, Netgen, an advancing
front 2d/3d-mesh generator based on abstract rules.  Comput.  Visual.
Sci., 52, 1--41, 1997.} libraries (see the Gmsh reference manual for
information on the algorithms).@*

For 2D meshing, the available values of @code{@var{mesh}} are
@code{made} (MeshAdapt+Delaunay), @code{mead} (MeshAdapt), @code{dela}
(Delaunay) and @code{fron} (Frontal). There is no optimization.  The
default is @code{fron,made} and it is recommended to retain multimeshing
in use for meshing robustness sake. For 3D meshing, the available
values of @code{@var{mesh}} are currently limited to @code{netg}
(Netgen).  The available values of @code{@var{opti}} are @code{gmsh}
(Gmsh), @code{netg} (Netgen) and @code{gmne} (Gmsh+Netgen).
@c While the
@c default algorithm, @code{netg/gmne}, provides quite good quality
@c meshing, multimeshing can improve results significantly.
For convenience, two generic entries are also defined.  The entry
@code{default}, which is the default value, provides a good balance
between mesh quality and computation time.  The entry @code{qualmax}
provides the best results on mesh quality (full use of multimeshing).
The values of @code{default} are @code{fron,made} for the 2D case and
@code{netg/gmsh,netg/gmne} for the 3D case.  The values of
@code{qualmax} are @code{made,mead,dela,fron} for the 2D case and
@code{netg/gmsh,netg/netg,netg/gmne} for the 3D case.

@opt{-mesh2dalgo, char_string,
Specify the 2D meshing algorithm.
Multimeshing is allowed by providing several algorithms@comma{}
(combine with commas).,
made@comma{} mead@comma{} dela@comma{} fron@comma{},
default @w{(= fron@comma{}made)}}

@opt{-mesh3dalgo, char_string,
Specify the 3D meshing algorithm.
Multimeshing is allowed by providing several algorithms@comma{}
(combine with commas).,
netg@comma{} netg/netg@comma{} netg/gmsh@comma{} netg/gmne@comma{},
default @w{(= netg/gmsh@comma{}netg/gmne)}}

@optsec{-mesh3doptiexpr, string,
Specify the value of @math{@var{O}} for the multimeshing
optimization@comma{} as a function of @var{Odis} and @var{Osize} (see
the Neper paper).,
any, Odis^0.8*Osize^0.2}

@optsec{-mesh3doptidisexpr, string,
Specify the value of @math{@var{Odis}} for the multimeshing
optimization@comma{} as a function of the element distortion parameter
@var{dis} (see the Neper paper).,
any, dis^(exp((dis^0.1)/(dis^0.1-1)))}


@subsection Domain Boundary Meshing Options

These options are for specifying geometry regularization and meshing
conditions for the polyhedra at the domain boundary different than those
that apply to the inner polyhedra.  This is useful for coarsening the
meshes of the boundary grains when they are disregarded in the analysis
due to possible boundary effects.
The domain boundary polyhedra can be defined using the
following variables: 
@itemize
@item @code{@var{body}}: the minimum number of polyhedra between the
considered polyhedron and the domain boundary. Its value is 0 for
polyhedra intersecting the domain boundary, and increases with the
distance to the domain boundary.

@item @code{@var{true}}: a polyhedron is said to be @dfn{true} if its
shape is not biased by the domain boundary.  This requires the
polyhedron not to be cut by the domain boundary, but actually the
condition is a bit more restrictive.  The value of @code{@var{true}}
is an integer equal to 0 for polyhedra which do not match the
above-mentionned criterion, and higher values otherwise.
For the latter cases, the value of @code{@var{true}} is defined to be
equal to @math{n} for true polyhedra surrounded by polyhedra whose value
of @code{@var{true}} is higher than or equal to @math{(n-1)}.  This
definition is consistent with the one of the @code{@var{body}} variable,
in terms of how the values of neighbouring grains compare.  As for
@code{@var{body}}, the value of @code{@var{true}} increases with the
distance to the domain boundary, but typically
@iftex
@math{@var{true} @leq @var{body}}.
@end iftex
@ifinfo
true <= body.
@end ifinfo

@end itemize

@opt{-dbound,char_string,
Define which polyhedra belong to the domain boundary.  The expression
can be based on the following arguments: @code{body} and @code{true}.
An example is @code{"body<=1"}.
,
any, none}

@opt{-dboundcl and -dboundrcl,real,
Absolute or relative characteristic length of the elements at the domain
boundary.  @code{rcl} is defined relative to the average polyhedron
volume.
,
any, none}

@optsec{-dboundsel and -dboundrsel,real,
Absolute or Relative Small Edge (maximum) Length at the domain boundary.
The relative small edge length is defined relative to the default value.
By default@comma{} @code{@var{sel}} is set so as to avoid mesh
over-refinement (@code{@var{cl}}/@code{@var{pl}}).  Use this option if
you want to choose a different length.,
any,-sel @code{@var{cl}}/@code{@var{pl}}}

@optsec{-dboundpl,real,
Progression factor for the element characteristic lengths. This value is
the maximum ratio between the lengths of two adjacent 1D elements.,
any >= 1, 2}

@item Fem-Evps format: files @file{.parms}, @file{.mesh}, @file{.surf}, @file{.opt} and @file{.bcs}
@end itemize

The following files are for describing the partitions:

@itemize
@item Node partition description, file @file{.npart}:
@w{@code{@var{node_id partition_id}}}.
The partition identifier ranges from 1 to the total number of
partitions.

@item Element partition description, file @file{.epart}:

@subsection Tessellation

@itemize
@item Neper-native tessellation file: @file{.tess}

See @ref{File Formats} for the file syntax.

@item Gmsh geometry file: @file{.geo}

It contains a minimal description of the tessellation, written under the
Gmsh geometry file format @file{.geo}.  This file can be opened with
Gmsh for visualization.  If the tessellation has been regularized, Gmsh
will complain about surfaces not being plane, but for visualization this
can be disregarded. (Note that you can even get
a mesh of the tessellation out from Gmsh, but it will be of lower
quality than by using module @code{-FM}.)

It contains a description of the tessellation written under the
standard ``Polygon File Format'' @file{.ply}.

@end itemize

@subsection Statistics

Below are some examples of advanced use.

@item @emph{Multimeshing.} Improve mesh quality as far as possible through 3D multimeshing.
@com{neper -FM n10-id1.tess -maxff 20 -rcl 0.8 -order 2}
@comx{-format tess,msh,abq -o n10}
@comx{-mesh3dalgo netg/gmsh,netg/netg,netg/gmne}

@item @emph{Mesh partitionning.} Like 2., but partition in 8 partitions
and renumber the nodes and elements accordingly.
@com{neper -FM n10-id1.tess -maxff 20 -rcl 0.8 -order 2}
@comx{-format tess,msh,abq -o n10}
@comx{-partq 8 -partrenum 1}

@item @emph{Orthotropic mesh refinement.} Mesh tessellation
@file{n10-id1.tess} with different element characteristic lengths
along x, y and z: @math{@var{rcl}=1}, @math{@var{rcl}=0.5} and
@math{@var{rcl}=0.25}, respectively. Use geometry regularization.
@com{neper -FM n10-id1.tess -rcl3 1 0.5 0.25 -maxff 20}

@item @emph{Data transport 1/2.} Like 7., and transport data defined on
@file{n10.msh} to @file{n10-b.msh}.  The data are 3D vectors given in
file @file{data} (format = 3 coordinates per line).
@com{neper -FM -remesh n10.msh -remeshtess n10.tess -rcl 0.5}
@comx{-transport n10.msh 1 elt real3 data -o n10-b}

@item @emph{Data transport 2/2.} Transport data from an existing old mesh
@file{n10.msh} to an existing new mesh @file{n10-b.msh}.  The data are
3D vectors given in file @file{data} (format = 3 coordinates per line). 
@com{neper -FM -loadmesh n10-b.msh}
