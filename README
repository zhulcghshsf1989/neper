Neper
=====

This is the source for the Neper software package.

Neper is a 3D random polycrystal generator for the finite element
method. The polycrystals are represented as 3D Voronoi tessellations and
can be meshed either regularly (cubic elements) or freely (tetrahedral
elements). Neper enables to generate and properly mesh large-scale
Voronoi tessellations, that is, tessellations containing typically more
than a thousand grains.

Neper is built around five modules: Neper -T (tessellation generation),
Neper -FM (free meshing), Neper -MM (mapped meshing), Neper -O
(crystallographic orientation generation) and Neper -VS (visualization).
Neper aims to be an easy-to-use, robust and efficient tool. All the
input data are prescribed non-interactively, using command lines and /
or ASCII files. Neper can be compiled and run on any Unix-like system.
